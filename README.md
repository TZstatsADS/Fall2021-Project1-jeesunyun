### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: Philosophy Data Project: Change in Word Usage over time
+ This project is conducted by [Jee sun Yun]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] I focused on the EDAs of the data, especially in the number of sentences and length of sentences per school and author. I also included a word cloud to see if the authors had a shift in topic or word usage over time.
